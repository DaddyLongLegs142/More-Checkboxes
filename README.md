# More Checkboxes

This plugin adds additional checkbox types and styles
Based on alternate checkboxes in Minimal theme by @kepano

## Features
4 new task states in addition to open and complete:
- In progress
- Scheduled
- Forwarded
- Cancelled

Clicking on the checkbox will cycle through these states
### Planned Features
- Bullet icons: use markdown checkbox syntax to create unique icons for things like dates, times, people, warnings, etc. Maintains human readable plaintext with the the relevant character between the checkbox brackets.
- Settings to customize which additional checkboxes you will use, allowing for a user interface uncluttered by unused features.

## Known Issues
- Checkbox doesn't properly cycle back to 'open' state. This currently has to be done by directly editing the markdown.
